This is the code book for the assignment in the Data science course (course Getting and cleaning data) on Coursera. 

About the variables:
X_train, y_train, X_test, y_test, subject_train, subject_test, features, activity_labels are variables (and files) in the downloaded zip file.
merge_train, merge_test and merge_all are variables that merge the previously mentioned data for further analysis.

About the R script (stepwise):
1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

About the data:
The data is downloaded from the assignment page on Coursera in course 3 Getting and cleaning data (week 4).
